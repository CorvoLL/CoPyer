##Software development process

Software will be uploaded and versioned on GitHub, using a milestone system.   
Frequent minor updates for bug fixing and major ones for features adding. Major updates will lead to a beta version prior to merging to the main branch while minor ones will be directly pushed to repository and lead to a nightly build.  


Software versioning will follow this pattern : vX.YY(b)  
Where X will be the major realease number and YY the minor one. These numbers will be followed by a "b" for beta versions.
